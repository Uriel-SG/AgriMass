# AgriMass - A Free and Unlimited Mass Mailing Tool  

## 📖 Project Background  
My company needed a mass mailing tool to reach all our customers, and I was tasked with finding a suitable one. I initially opted for MailChimp, leveraging its trial period since the free version is quite limited. After completing the task, I wondered:  

> *Why do all these tools come with restrictions or require a paid plan?*  
> *Why not create an independent, unlimited, and free tool that does the same job?*  

And so... **AgriMass** was born. 🚀
